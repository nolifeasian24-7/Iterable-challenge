# start
a friend gave me a code challenge, in java mind you, it was to learn hashMap, and i originally started doing it, however quickly noticed that i didnt know shit about iterables, so, i used the array sorting python language to create a simple guide for me to convert to java, have a look and let me know what you think!
i will soon commit a java version of this repository, so stay tuned. While your here, give me a follow :)
