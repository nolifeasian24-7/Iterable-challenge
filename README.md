# start
a friend gave me a code challenge, in java mind you, it was to learn hashMap, and i originally started doing it, however quickly noticed that i didnt know anything about iterables, so, i used the array sorting python language to create a simple guide for me to convert to java, have a look and let me know what you think!
I recently commited a java version of my start program, I hope you enjoy
While your here, give me a follow :)
